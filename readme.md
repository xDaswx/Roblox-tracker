tracker is used to track accounts on the Roblox application

Basically requests are made according to the id but I didn't add support for proxies (sorry), maybe in the future I will add it if I have time.

I saw a script similar to this some time ago so I decided to improve it, I don't remember who created it first

But anyway it's like https://www.roblox.com/games/176053469/New-User-Machine

It's simple to use, only Node.js is needed (https://nodejs.org/en)

node tracker.js --id `START_ID` --delta `AMOUNT RPS` (request per second)
